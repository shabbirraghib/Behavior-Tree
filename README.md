# ü§ñ Robot Behavior Tree Task üå≤

This C++ project demonstrates a robot performing a specific task using a **Behavior Tree (BT)** powered by the [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) library.  
The robot navigates to a room, interacts with a fridge, picks up an apple, and exits ‚Äî all simulated with print statements and dummy action classes (no ROS involved).

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.cpp`  
  Defines and executes the behavior tree using BehaviorTree.CPP.

- `actions.hpp`  
  Contains dummy condition and action classes with logging.

- `CMakeLists.txt`  
  CMake configuration file for building the project.
